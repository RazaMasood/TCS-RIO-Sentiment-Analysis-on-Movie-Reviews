# TCS-RIO-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews

### This project is a sentiment analysis system that automates the detection of different sentiments from textual comments and feedback, specifically movie reviews. It utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm and the TF-IDF vectorization technique to train a classifier and predict the sentiment of new textual data.

# Project Description:
### Project Objective & Brief: To develop a deep learning algorithm to detect different types of sentiment contained in a collection of English Sentences or a large paragraph.

## Project Guidelines:
### 1. Identify & finalize a collection of English sentences or a large paragraph which will also cover contradictory statements.
### 2. Develop a deep learning model for detection & segmentation of sentiments whether positive, negative, or neutral from the paragraph.
### 3. Test the model accuracy.

## Expected Project Outcome:
### 1. Algorithms to detect different types of sentiment from a paragraph.
### 2. Detailed presentation with proof of reasonable accuracy.

# Solution Approch: 
### 1. Read the dataset of movie reviews from a CSV file. 

### 2. Preprocess the reviews by converting them to lowercase, removing punctuation and HTML tags. 

### 3. Convert numbers in the reviews into words. 

### 4. Remove stopwords from the reviews. 

### 5. Encode the sentiment labels as binary values. 

### 6. Apply TF-IDF vectorization to convert the textual data into numerical features. 

### 7. Split the dataset into training and testing sets. 

### 8. Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the training set. 

### 9. Evaluate the classifier's performance by predicting the sentiment on the testing set. 

### 10. Create a confusion matrix to analyze the performance of the classifier.
